ID 240325 – Africa Trade Competitiveness and Market Access (ATCMA) Programme – SADC Obstacles to intra-regional trade in Southern Africa consist of poor infrastructure, low manufacturing production and low quality of exported products, restrictive business environments, mismatch between the needs of other regions in Africa and exports of Southern African countries, technical barriers to trade, weak financial integration and the lack of market information on existing opportunities in other African regional communities. Moreover, enterprises, especially women-led and youth-led Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) within the continent, continue to face challenges that hinder their ability to participate effectively in sustainable intra-regional trade, hampering value addition and job creation. The programme aligns with the African Union’s Agenda 2063 and in particular its flagship initiative; the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).",
